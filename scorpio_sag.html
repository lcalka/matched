						<h2>HERE'S THE DEAL</h2>
						<section>
							<p>
								If a Scorpio and a Sagittarius want to make a love match, they should be warned to slow down, take their time getting to know one another on a deep, significant level or else they run the risk of getting way ahead of themselves. This relationship could be over before either partner even realizes it’s started if they’re not careful! Their patience will be very richly rewarded. Sagittarius thrives on change, on the new and the exciting and on the power of positive thought. Scorpio just wants to get closer and strengthen emotional ties. Early in the relationship, Sagittarius could feel hemmed in by Scorpio’s rapt attention and high expectations for love. If Scorpio can control their emotions, these two are in for satisfaction and excitement.
							</p>

							<p>
								Both Scorpio and Sagittarius see each day as an adventure (or in Scorpio’s case, a compelling mystery) and as an endless opportunity to explore, to probe, to learn. Shared escapades bring them closer. While Sagittarius may get fed up with Scorpio’s stubbornness and inflexibility, Scorpio could be thinking their Sagittarius mate is just a little too hotheaded. They’ll enjoy learning together, and travel could be very beneficial for this pair. Their relationship is always on the go!

							</p>

							<p>	
								Pluto and Mars rule Scorpio, and Mars and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. Mars is the God of War, opening the door for Scorpio’s determined, courageous character. Mars, when combined with Pluto, represents rebirth and renewal. Jupiter focuses on philosophy, higher learning, expansion, optimism, luck and travel. These planetary attributes — of growth, expansion and masculine energy — combine to create a sustainable relationship of mutual admiration.
							</p>

							<p>
								Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. Sagittarius is the spontaneous partner, heading in the direction their whim leads them, while Scorpio’s motives are more subdued, less easy to read. Even if they run into misunderstandings or misinterpretations of each other’s motivations, crisis can be averted. If these love mates agree that their relationship is significant, their devotion and affection will see them through.
							</p>

							<p>
								Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Both of these love mates can multitask like pros, keeping each other’s interests at heart, juggling birthdays and special dates with family obligations, but it really takes Scorpio’s follow-through to get anything finished in this pair. Sagittarius gets the urge to jump around from project to project, so Scorpio’s stick-to-it-tivness comes in handy. Lucky for Scorp partners, Sagittarius notices all the work their mates put in — and they definitely show their appreciation when they know it’s needed. Scorpio can be stubborn, exacting and demanding, so this mate needs to give their Sagittarius love their personal space and time for their own interests. Scorpio leads Sagittarius’ ideas fruition, even if Sagittarius has lost interest and moved on. So they’re not all work and no play, Sagittarius comes through with their knack for flexibility, a positive quality that sometimes wins out over resolute determination.
							</p>

							<p>
								What’s the best thing about the Scorpio-Sagittarius relationship? The security and flexibility they can give one another. Once they open up to one another and to appreciate their different philosophies in love and in life, these two have potential for steamy relations, deep connections and heartfelt respect. As long as they communicate and celebrate their differences, theirs will be a passionate relationship.
